## FutureX
[![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/steales/FutureX/total.svg)]()
### FutureX is a very bad Minecraft Java hacked client. I have taken it to myself to upload the files so it is now free :)
(RIP FutureX LLLLLL)

- The Client is a Forge mod for 1.12.2 and is a snow skid (or was at some point). Please bully the owner for me as he hates me already! Stay mad Aryan!
- A buildable src leak will be released into the github so you can skid/modify the cliwnt easier.
