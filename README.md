## FutureX/ExVision
[![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/steales/FutureX/total.svg)]()
### FutureX is a very bad Minecraft Java hacked client. I have taken it to myself to upload the files so it is now free :)
(RIP FutureX LLLLLL)

- The client has been renamed to ExVision (FutureX 2.0) and I am uploading this file. The client does have HWID but has not been opened, and unfortunately is obfuscated (I will deobfuscate soon).
- The Client is a Forge mod for 1.12.2 and is a snow skid (or was at some point).
- A buildable src leak will be released into the github so you can skid/modify the client easier.
